<p class="quote">The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is 
often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex 
and involves many aspects – technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches 
not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward 
increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and 
community operations.</p>

<p>As the Internet evolved, one of the <span>major challenges</span> was how to propagate the changes
to the software, particularly the host software. DARPA supported UC Berkeley to
investigate modifications to the Unix operating system, including incorporating 
TCP/IP developed at BBN. Although Berkeley later rewrote the BBN code to more efficiently 
fit into the Unix system and kernel, the incorporation of TCP/IP into the Unix BSD system 
releases proved to be a critical element in dispersion of the protocols to the research community. </p>


<p>Much of the CS research community began to use Unix BSD for their day-to-day computing environment. 
Looking back, the strategy of incorporating Internet protocols into a supported operating system for 
the research community was one of the key elements in the successful widespread adoption of the 
Internet.</p>
